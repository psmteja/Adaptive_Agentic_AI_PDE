{"prompt": "You are an AI assistant that designs energy-efficient Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for PDE surrogate modeling tasks.\n\nTask description:\nPDE surrogate task using Poseidon teacher; model_size=T, image_size=128, num_in_channels=4, num_out_channels=4.\n\nObjective:\nWe want an energy-efficient FNO configuration that balances accuracy, model size, and speed. We use a weighted score:\n  score = 0.3 * loss_norm + 0.35 * params_norm + 0.35 * time_norm\nwhere lower is better, and each 'norm' is min-max normalized across the candidates.\n\nWe ran several FNO configurations and measured their performance:\n- baseline_32w_4L_16m: width=32, num_layers=4, modes_x=16, modes_y=16, num_params=1054180, final_eval_loss=0.027741, avg_epoch_time_s=3.469\n- fewer_modes_32w_4L_8m: width=32, num_layers=4, modes_x=8, modes_y=8, num_params=267748, final_eval_loss=0.029109, avg_epoch_time_s=3.472\n- smaller_model_16w_3L_8m: width=16, num_layers=3, modes_x=8, modes_y=8, num_params=50404, final_eval_loss=0.030722, avg_epoch_time_s=1.811\n\nQuestion:\n1. Which configuration is the best under this objective?\n2. Justify your choice by explaining the trade-offs between accuracy, model size, and speed.\n3. Then restate the recommended configuration in a clear, machine-readable JSON block with keys:\n   {\"label\", \"width\", \"num_layers\", \"modes_x\", \"modes_y\", \"num_params\"}.\n", "response": "The best configuration under the given weighted objective is 'smaller_model_16w_3L_8m'.\n\nReasoning:\n- Accuracy: It has eval loss 0.030722, within the range [0.027741, 0.030722] seen in the experiments, and it is relatively strong compared to the others.\n- Model size: It uses 50,404 parameters, compared to the range [50404, 1054180].\n- Speed: It runs in 1.811 seconds per epoch on cpu, compared to the range [1.811, 3.472].\nGiven the chosen weights, this configuration provides a good balance between low eval loss and acceptable size/speed. More aggressive compression would reduce parameters and speed further but at the cost of noticeably worse accuracy.\n\nRecommended configuration in JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"label\": \"smaller_model_16w_3L_8m\",\n  \"width\": 16,\n  \"num_layers\": 3,\n  \"modes_x\": 8,\n  \"modes_y\": 8,\n  \"num_params\": 50404\n}\n```"}
